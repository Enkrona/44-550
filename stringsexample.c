//  C does not have a String class for variables
//  Instead it uses NTCA (Null terminated character arrays)
//  terminates with the ASCII terminator for "\0" 

//  EX: char name[] = {'b', 'r', 'a', 'd', '\0'}; = "brad\0" = "brad" 
//  EX: can also be defined as char lname = "this works too!"; 
//  #include <string.h> is the string library 
//  Be sure to check out the cplusplus.com site for docs on strings
//  and other libraries which are great. 
//
//  the "" expands the char array to include the null temrinator
