Cache will normally:
	- Spatial: Is a area of contigous memeory which the OS loads to the CPU Cache 
		- of memory which is near and it thinks will be used due to the program
	- Ro major: Rows of contigous memory
	- Column major: Columns of contigous memory 

RAM is ~13x slower than cache - needs clock cycles to investigate and read it

This example code displays how much data is loaded into RAM, how much more effective writing code which exploits that "contigous" memory model. 

The second timing is non-contigous makes it much more difficult and time-consuming it is!
